I tried to do my best in short time, to have the following points:

1. working solution, from end to end
2. componentized code - split subjects to different components and parts.
3. splited my effort to tasks - skeleton, header, service, results pad, styling, mobile support.
4. did every demand in the readme bullets.
5. tried to do as close as possible to the design (not 100% the same)

what I didn't do:
1. didnt use  MUI or other ui framework
2. didnt use style pallete - relative sizes (REM etc)
3. didnt handle edge cases in the data - 
4. styling is far from perfect. should be better
5. components, and css, and app is not modulized well
6. didnt add tests, and pipline build etc...
